The tentative project title
---------------------------

Traveling trends in NYC as a Result of Covid-19

The motivation for this project
-------------------------------

This project is important as it will allow us to better understand how
Covid-19 has impacted mobility trends in NYC. Mobility trends may be
associated with both covid-19 infection and economic implications
associated with consumer spending. Thus, understanding mobility trends
is crucial in order to guide policymakers, transit, and health
departments as they make decisions related to stay at home orders in
light of covid-19.

The intended final products
---------------------------

Ggplot and map to visualize mobility trends as well as summary tables.

The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges
---------------------------------------------------------

We plan to conduct analyses and produce visualizations of trends in
mobility in NYC over time and associations between mobility trends and
Covid-19 case counts. Visualizations - We would like to look at subway
foot traffic, restaurant traffic, and flight traffic patterns to and
from NYC and ascertain how these trends were affected by COVID-19
through graphical visualizations. Map - We would also like to create a
map to spatially visualize the mobility trends and COVID-19 cases over
time and to look at how these trends differ by borough. Coding
challenges: working with untidy data, combining datasets in a meaningful
manner, creating maps

The planned timeline
--------------------
